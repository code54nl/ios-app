Uurapp iOS-app
==============

The iOS client app for Uurapp

Uurapp is a timetracking and invoicing webapplication, currently only in Dutch. It is build and owned by Code54 (Netherlands). Users can log worked time in a Android and iOS app. These apps are now available as open source projects on GitHub.

I'm planning to open source the complete Uurapp application in the near future, so the ASP.NET Webforms application as well. 

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions. If you want to try Uurapp, you can create a free account (limited to 1 user and 3 invoices each month) at http://www.uurapp.nl

Kind regards,
